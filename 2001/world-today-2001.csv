Election forum and public opinion,"John Taylor (Reporter); Now to our election forum, in the second week of a campaign that can't seem to shake off the khaki. Last week began with news of the start of the bombing in Afghanistan. This week the election was once again pushed out of the headlines by the Prime Minister's announcement that Australians will be joining the military action.While the deployment announcement was supported 100 per cent by Kim Beazley, its timing won't have pleased Labor. Not only did it totally swamp Labor's banking policy launch, and a National Press Club debate on education between the Minister and Labor's education spokesman, but it came as Labor was still basking in the good reception to Kim Beazley after the weekend leader's debate.The Government also managed to surprise Labor this week on the economic front - releasing updated budget figures a day before the Charter of Budget Honesty was released under the election rules.And, as predicted, the cupboard is almost bare. With a surplus only a third as large as originally forecast.But, today while the Prime Minister continues campaigning in Queensland, Labor is pushing ahead with the release of its much anticipated policy on rolling back the Gst.In a moment we'll be talking to our election analysts Gerard Henderson and Malcolm McGregor. But first to the voices of some swinging voters - this week John Taylor has been talking to voters in Queensland.Fiona",2001-10-19,ABC Radio.
