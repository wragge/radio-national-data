Christian traditions mark multicultural society,"Nick Grimm (Reporter); Easter is a time of year when most of us enjoy a holiday of some kind. And many, regardless of religious background, will probably indulge in the odd Easter egg or two, maybe even a hot cross bun.But for most Australians is it only about chocolate and buns, or does Easter have some other meaning?In our multi-religious society, do we still identify as Christian?Well, according to the latest census figures, the overwhelming majority of respondents stated that their religious affiliation was Christian. Only 5 per cent nominated non-Christian religions, but interestingly, over a quarter stated that they had no religion at all.But it's the non-Christian religions which have increased in numbers over the last 10 years. Since the 1996 Census figures there's been a 79 per cent increase in affiliations to Buddhism, 42 per cent to Hinduism, 40 per cent to Islam and 5 per cent to Judaism.Where does that leave the Christians?In a moment I'll ask our panel of three eminent Australians exactly that question.But first, this report from Nick Grimm.Shopkeeper",2005-03-26,ABC Radio.
