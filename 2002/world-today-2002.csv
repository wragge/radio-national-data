NRMA president found guilty of breaking corporate law,"Simon Santow (Reporter); Corporate governance has been one of the most talked about issues globally over the last few weeks. Overseas, the shonky accounting practices of Worldcom and Andersens have hit the headlines, while at home, shareholders and the business community have been shocked by revelations of corporate misconduct at Hih and Onetel.Now a decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court this morning has further dented the image of company directors.Nrma president Nicholas Whitlam has been found to have breached the corporations law at the motoring giant's annual general meeting four years ago.The charges arose out of Mister Whitlam's refusal to sign 4,000 proxy votes assigned to him.
